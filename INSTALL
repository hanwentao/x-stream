  Installation
  ------------

  X-Stream requires boost to work. To build and install X-Stream just run:

    $ make
    $ make install

  The default installation prefix is /usr/local. You can change this to prefix
  PREFIX by running:

    $ make install prefix=PREFIX

  ALS
  ---

  Alternating Least Squares algorithm in X-Stream requires additional
  dependencies. Because of this, it is commented out in the code. It requires
  the LAPACK linear algebra library and boost numeric bindings to be able to
  use it.

  To install the LAPACK library on Debian/Ubuntu run:

    $ apt-get install liblapack-dev

  You can get boost numeric bindings from
  http://mathema.tician.de/software/boost-numeric-bindings. Either check out
  from the git repository or download a ready-made archive and unpack it. Then
  run:

    $ cd boost-numeric-bindings 
    $ ./configure 
    $ make install

  X-Stream Makefile assumes bindings are installed with the default prefix
  /usr/local. If you change this, adapt the Makefile accordingly.

  Finally, uncomment the lines related to ALS in benchmark/driver.cpp and the
  following line in the Makefile: SYSLIBS += -llapack, and run make again.
