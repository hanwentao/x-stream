A termination proof for the mis algorithm implemented for undirected graphs
G=(V,E):

Let V(i) be the MIS at the end of the ith superstep.

Theorem 1: 
(1) V(2*n) is an independent set. 
(2) For any edge (u,v) with u in V(2*n) and v outside, u < v.
(3) V(2*n + 1) 

Trivially true for V(0) as the lower numbered end votes out the higher numbered
end.

Assume that it is true till V(2*i). 

Since V(2*i) is independent no vertex can be voted out of it and hence 
V(2*i + 1) contains V(2*i). The vertices in V(2*i + 1) - V(2*i) cannot be
connected to any vertex in V(2*i) as any such connection must be from a lower
numbered vertex in V(2*i) and hence would have out-voted the other
vertex. Therefore V(2*i + 1) consists of two disconnected partitions V(2*i) and
V(2*i + 1) - V(2*i).

At the next step therefore, not only does V(2*i) survive but in addition the
edges connecting vertices in V(2*i + 1) - V(2*i) out-vote all the higher
numbered ends. V(2*i + 2) hence satisfies both (1) and (2).

Theorem 2: If V(2*n + 1) is strictly larger than V(2*n) then V(2*n + 2) is
strictly larger than V(2*n).

Proof: This means at least one vertex has been added to V(2*n + 1). Let u be the
minimum numbered vertex in V(2*n + 1) - V(2*n). u cannot be out-voted from a
vertex in V(2*n) as those are disconnected from the ones in V(2*n + 1). u being
the minimum numbered vertex in V(2*n + 1) - V(2*n) cannot be out-voted by any
other vertex in that partition either. Hence u must be in V(2*n + 2).


Theorem: The algorithm terminates when the MIS is maximal and independent. Note
that the algorithm terminates when the MIS does not change.

Proof: Assuming that the size of the MIS does not change from 2*n to 2*n +
1. Therefore every vertex in V - V(2*n) must have at least one edge into V(2*n).
Therefore V(2*n) is maximal and independent by Theorem (1). The termination is
therefore correct.

V(2*n) covers every edge in G as otherwise an uncovered
edge would have added its lower numbered vertex to the MIS. The termination in
this case is therefore correct as the MIS is independent by theorem 1.

If the MIS does not change from 2*n + 1 to 2*n + 2 then this means that V(2n +
1) is independent as otherwise at least some vertex is voted out. Further V(2n +
1) must be maximal. Then there exists some vertices with no connection into V(2n
+ 1). In such a case however the minimum numbered vertex would have been added
to V(2n + 1).
